# Automatic journal Icon Numbers

This module will automatically apply numbered icons to journal entries that start with a number.  It supports the following numbering formats:
* [1-99]
* [A-Z][1-99]
* [1-99][A-Z]

For the single digit numbers, it support an option '0' padded format as well (i.e "A09", or "A9" )

To use, just drag correctly named journals to your map. The icon will be automatically selected to match the name.

The multiple styles seen in the example can be selected from the config menu.  


**As of 1.0.4, all legacy icons auto migrate to the uploads folder**



## Known issues

* If you rename a note using the "Text Label", you need to re-edit it to get the new icon.
